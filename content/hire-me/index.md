# About me

Hi, I'm Cezar (or Cesar).

I design and build systems in the cloud. I work on software that must
feel invisible to end-users, software that is capable, reliable and
highly available. The software I usually build deals almost exclusively
with other machines rather than humans. You guessed it - I design and
build infrastructure, servers and microservices.

Feel free to reach out to me, either on [LinkedIn] or via [email], or
[book a meeting] right now!

- Go and Rust

  practices
